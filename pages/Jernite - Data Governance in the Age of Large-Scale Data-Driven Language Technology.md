- Abstract:
	- The recent emergence and adoption of Machine Learning technology, and specifically of Large Language Models, has drawn attention to the need for systematic and transparent management of language data. This work proposes an approach to global language data governance that attempts to organize data management amongst stakeholders, values, and rights. Our proposal is informed by prior work on distributed governance that accounts for human values and grounded by an international research collaboration that brings together researchers and practitioners from 60 countries. The framework we present is a multi-party international governance structure focused on language data, and incorporating technical and organizational tools needed to support its work.
- Notes
	- “striking a balance between a system’s stability and ability to evolve” Wareham on the governance of software projects
	- “endogenous notions of technical performance and novelty,” Birhane on the narrow values driving ML research
	- “devising a governance structure based solely on values expressed by our participants runs the risk of prioritizing their interests and excluding visions” on the risk of limiting feedback to active participants
	- “grounding the definition of our proposed values in Human Rights frameworks constitutes an appealing starting point” while the diversity of human rights framings means this tactic is only a way to postpone reflexion
	- “human-centric data brings with it concerns around how an individual is represented, how that representation may affect them, the represented individual’s consent, and other fundamental and legal rights” on the special challenges of dealing with human-centric data
	- “data creation, selection, curation, documentation, dissemination, hosting and serving, conservation, tracking, versioning, and deletion” the lifecycle of a dataset
	- “The governance work provides norms, frameworks, and communication mechanisms in order to e.g. help operationalize definitions of contestation in different legal contexts to allow for the development of locally relevant supporting tools, or to formalize relations between actors in different roles and parts of the world” on the hierarchy between data governance, sourcing and tooling
	- “accumulate, categorize, organize, and document data for datasets” data sourcing
	- “representation by e.g. removing barriers to entry and lowering risk of participation” on how governance may help sourcing
	- “what consitutes a legitimate removal request”
	- “non-dissemination of the data; that is, if data modelers and researchers can use it without making and broadcasting their own copies” data contestation issues where governance is relevant
	- “identify social variables that can engender discrimination in inter-personal interactions and meetings with technology”
	- “the stigmatization of the language varieties not associated with status and power” noisy vs. clean text
	- “there is an ongoing debate about whether and when using copyrighted data for training models constitutes “fair use””
	- “The U.S. Copyright Office recently issued an exemption to liability for removing digital rights management software for the purposes of text and data mining for non-commercial research.7 Japan and Europe have passed similar legislation making it easier to use data for text and data mining for research purposes” on the fair use of scrapped data
	- “For digital language data, a big issue is that most longer texts are unique and difficult to anonymize” on the particular privacy concerns of user-created text data
	- “Given that trained ML models might be queried for specific information about individuals [26], a governance model would have to consider not only whether and how to remove specific instances from its datasets, but also how to minimize the risk of memorization”
	- “allowing marginalized populations better control over how they are represented in the data used to train ML systems in an effort to lessen algorithmic discrimination, and by supporting auditability of these systems”
	- “data used to train them are one further step removed from the task-specific models built from them, so the link between data and ML progress is even more abstracted”
	- “research addressing dataset choices, creation, and curation, is systematically “under-valued and de-glamorised””
	- “there is no place for multiple stakeholders and rights-holders to align on priorities, giving the governing organization full say over how the data should be shared and used” on the downsides of centralizing dataset management for easy consumption, abstracting away data producers
	- “autonomy, consent, and contestation are difficult if not practically impossible for public dataset repositories, due to the full reliance on self-governance” on the dificulty to enforce data governance in user-contributed repositories
	- “the goals of reproducible research that underlie the public recording of datasets are inherently in tension with the need to update datasets to accommodate requests to remove personal information [121], and unredacted copies may circulate for years” on the tensions between reproducibilty and data contestation
	- “to create some consistency for editors and end-users of Wikimedia data, the data is governed in part through content licenses” on having clear standards for what constitutes fair use data sharing
	- “contestation, consent, privacy, attribution, and just rewards” rights of data subjects and creators
	- “the diversity and representativity of the data available to the governance organization will depend on the ability of the hosts to establish relationships and support the need of the greater variety of data providers”
	- Actors in the proposed governance structure: rights-holders, providers, hosts, modelers, stewards and helpers
	- “If the Provider is proposing data that is curated from external sources, especially text that is regulated by general data protection laws, there is also an implicit relationship between Data Host and Rights-holders” some responsibilities trickle down the value chain
	- “a non-dissemination clause. The Modeler may be required to obtain a fresh version of any dataset reflecting the most recent version of the data host after a fixed amount of time.” how to navigate the tension between reproducibility and contestation
