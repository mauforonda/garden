- Some notes
	- [Multi scale measures of segregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2pS5aXeibs) `youtube`. The authors measure ethnic and income similarity within spatial units at 100 different proximity scales and multiple times for the Netherlands. Each unit measures 100 meters square, which allows for observing segregation dynamics at a very fine level and up, like how segregation can spread among contiguous units and shape higher level patterns. Then they model how the share of low income people around each person's household affects their own income. They find that the effect is small and, contrary to the literature, not always higher at smaller scales. I'm curious about what mechanisms might be mediating these effects at higher scales. A different followup analysis might switch observation units to neighborhoods and estimate higher level scales via patterns in street networks. While the Netherlands creates these data from administrative records, other European countries publish estimates at a similar resolution based on many parameters. Another extension to model the effect of the spatial context on individual outcomes could be to integrate non-residential spaces, like workspaces and commuting paths.

	- A [roundup of projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKF5lK2NRB4) `youtube` by the [Georgia Tech Friendly Cities Lab](https://friendlycities.gatech.edu/) with a refresher on basic spatial statistics metrics. The work seems to be very visual, so maybe check that with your eyes later. Contrary to the previous talk, this work leans mors towards the exploratory and playful, but still retains some academic rigour. Plus, they claim to build stuff in #python and publish the code online.

	- Another [talk by Christa Brelsford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j44Jy8ZlrLE) `youtube` along the lines of the traditional Santa Fe Institute cult-like complexity optimism. The takeaway was that more dimensions of human behavior should be incorporated in climate, disease spread and urban dynamics models, as they represent the greater source of uncertainty.

	- The language of neighborhood change and stability. The author used data from zillow, a property marketplace, to explore the effect of a new train line on surrounding neighborhoods, how prices vary in proximity to the stations, how often and in what publications is the new line mentioned in, what other factors are frequent in publications. Then they take [the HMDA database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/), which has the ethnic and income distribution of mortgage applicants in a neighborhood, and test whether white people were more intersted in these neighborhoods after the line was built, relative to black people, via a difference-in-differences model. They find they do. The HMDA database looks amazing to explore gentrification patterns, like how white affluent people will purchase property in minority neighborhoods and push more vulnerable populations away. In a follow-up project, they build a classifier to sort properties based on text in their advertisements according to a gentrification typology built on HMDA data. Based on their small sample size, they only test this in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the lack of controls, I'd be hesitant to believe good  predictions aren't picking confounding factors or that the classifier would work in other cities. I'd also like to see how this predictions compare with data from the census and sources of population data. Also, they seem to have improvised a lot when doing the text analysis, for example a simple initial estimate for a word's relative importance would be it's TF-IDF, but according to the questions session the author had barely heard of it.

	- Street network models and indicators, a talk about [[Boeing - Street Network Models and Indicators for Every Urban Area in the World]]. The author talks about work that led up to this paper, where he characterized the history of street networks in US cities, and some more recent work that uses its results, like testing the effect of network features on carbon emissions, or building a classification of street networks.

		- LATER Check the source for historical US street networks.
		- LATER Collect patterns reported in the academic literature for street network indicators, like scaling laws or elasticities.
		- LATER Check previous work on assessing the quality of openstreetmap data, what methods do they use? what data can we rely on for cities in Bolivia?
