- _The International Men and Gender Equality Survey_ ([IMAGES](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/)), collects international data on "_practices and attitudes around gender equality_". Two thirds of the questionnaire are the same for all countries, but some questions are adapted for every local context. Each country has a separate documentation sheet, all of which are [listed in the website](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/study-notes/).
- [Documentation for the Bolivia study](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bolivia_CountryProfile.pdf).
	- A quantitative study was carried out between April 8 and May 6, 2019 to understand the behavior and perceptions of the men and women populations in Bolivia between 18 and 59 years old. It was funded by the Swedish International Development Association (SIDA) and operated by the Centro de Generación de Información y Estadística ([CEGIE](https://www.upb.edu/es/centros-investigacion/cegie-investigadores)) of the UPB. The sample consisted of 887 women and 888 men from all 9 departments, in the urban and rural area. Urban blocks and rural communities were selected by stratifying the 2012 census results in two stages: by the proportion of urban to rural population, and by the proportion of the population that self-identified under different native groups. Subjects were selected randomly (so they claim) and questioned by interviewers of the same sex, who had previously participated in a 10-day training program. Finally, results were expanded by expansion factors based on the 2012 census.

	- A qualitative study was carried between October 2020 and January 2021 in which 57 men and 27 women, as well as 12 men and 5 women from 3 indigenous communities participated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews respectively. The study was designed by Acción por los Derechos Humanos and Promundo-US, and operated in collaboration with the Central de Organizaciones de Pueblos Nativos de Guarayos (COPNAG), Servicios Educativos (PROCESO) and the Centro de Investigación y Promoción del Campesinado (CIPCA).
	- Data can only be requested through [a form on their website](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/request-data-access/), which seems to be reviewed manually. They don't ask any personal information beyond a name and email so who knows how they're deciding who can be trusted with the data (an `.edu` email?).
- The [latest report](https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/International%20Men%20%26%20Gender%20Equality%20Survey%20%28IMAGES%29%20Global%20Report%202022_EN.pdf), from June 16 2022, claims that data from Bolivia , which was taken 3 years ago [see](((62cd916f-39cf-4206-9dc7-6c6d42976a45))), was just added this year.
	- Some cherry picked highlights
		- Bolivia and Kuwait are the only surveyed countries where no man claims to decide on the children's education alone. This group includes Chile, Uganda and Tanzania when women are asked. The discrepancy indicates that in many households, important decisions are made together by the couple or alone by women, but publicly claimed only by men.
		- Bolivia is the top country in Latin America where men remember their fathers doing domestic work.
		- Bolivia is by far the country with the highest proportion of men and women who agree with the statement "_A woman should tolerate violence in order to keep her family together_".
		- More than 50% of women report having experienced some form of intimate partner violence, the highest share in Latin America.
		- 59% of men who report seeing violence as children claim to perpetrate violence to their partners themselves. Across all countries in the survey, a higher percentage of men who saw violence as children, compared to those who didn't, reproduce that pattern in their own families later.
	- Most graphics in the report do a poor communication job. Visualization types are generic and often inappropriate, colors only encode category differences when they could say so much more, many suggested comparisons could be much clearer and eloquent. These are data with a strong emotional dimension and, without getting into cringe or manipulative territory graphics, should try to leverage it better.
