- Abstract:
	- Complex systems have become a popular lens for analyzing cities, and complexity theory has many implications for urban performance and resilience. This paper develops a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design. It extends quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics, and information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form. Today, prominent urban design movements openly embrace complexity but must move beyond metaphor and inspiration to formalize what "complexity" is and how we can use it to assess both the world as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.
- Notes
	- A literature review with a clear objective.
		- “a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design.”
	- On complexity and urban design
		- “Urban designers often discuss urban form and design projects in terms of complexity (e.g., Duany et al. 2001; Macdonald 2002; Talen 2003; Alexander 2003; Sanders 2008; Congress for the New Urbanism 2015)”
		- Coloquial definitions of _complexity_
			- “positively correlated with disorder and includes algorithmic complexity and most measures of entropy. Here, complexity is highest when objects are scrambled up with the greatest variety and diversity.” Category I complexity in the typology described in Shiner et al. (1999)
			- “a convex function of disorder, peaking at some midpoint between order and disorder. This balances variety and structure, conforming to traditional definitions of complex adaptive systems” Category II
			- “order or structure alone, favoring self-organization and emergence in which structure emerges from disorder.” Category III
	- Temporal complexity
		- “Derived from Shannon entropy, mean information gain assesses how much new information is gained from each subsequent datum in a time series (Proulx and Parrott 2008) and fluctuation complexity measures the amount of structure within a time series by evaluating the order of and relationship between its values.” On measures of temporal complexity
	- Visual complexity
		- “Much of the research on human perception of the built environment follows in the wake of Gibson’s (1979) ecological framework and Appleton’s (1975) prospect–refuge theory (e.g., Tveit et al. 2006; Ode et al. 2010).” On measures of visual complexity
		- “Ewing and Clemente (2013) perform a literature review yielding 51 perceptual qualities of urban environments, eight of which they select for further study because of their importance across the literature: imageability, enclosure, human scale, transparency, coherence, legibility, linkage, and visual complexity (cf. Ewing and Handy 2009).”
		- “Cavalcante et al. (2014) provide an alternate, statistical image processing measure of urban visual complexity.”
		- “Slow-moving pedestrians need a high level of complexity to hold their interest, but fast-moving motorists find that same environment chaotic”
	- Spatial complexity
		- “Boeing (2018b) adapts entropy measures to analyze urban spatial order through street orientations. Yeh and Li (2001) use entropy to monitor and track urban sprawl. Applying these information-theoretic metrics to space usually entails analyzing raster data for predictability.” On measures of spatial complexity
		- “Wissen Hayek et al. (2015) measure land use mix and density to evaluate the quality of the neighborhood-scale urban environment. The Simpson diversity index measures the entropy of objects across space and is a common measure of land use mixture in urban design research (economists often call it the Herfindahl–Hirschmann index, while ecologists call it the probability of interspecies encounter). It is an integral measure that considers land use in a district as a whole, ignoring microscale structure (Song et al. 2013a).”
		- “Measures of topological structure assess the shape and physical configuration of a system. They are perhaps the most applicable measures of the complexity outcomes of urban design because they characterize that which is most dependent upon the design process: physical structure and topological arrangement.”
	- Fractals
		- “Fractal structure refers to the roughness and self-similarity of some object, and how its detail relates to the scale at which it is observed (Jiang and Yin 2014).” On measures of scaling complexity
		- “Batty (e.g., 2005) has demonstrated how city structure and urban peripheries are fractal. Their features tend to be distributed according to a power law (a scale-free distribution)”
		- “Murcio et al. (2015) measure urban transfer entropy to examine multi-scale patterns and flows.”
		- “Measures of fractal dimension include the Hausdorff dimension and the box-counting dimension (Shen 2002).”
	- Connectivity
		- “The average street segment length is a linear proxy for block size and indicates the network’s grain.” On measures of connectivity
		- “Average circuity measures the ratio of edge lengths to the great-circle distances between the nodes these edges connect, indicating the street pattern’s efficiency (cf. Barthe ́lemy 2011).”
		- “Topological measures of street network structure more robustly indicate connectedness and configuration.”
		- “The network’s average node degree topologically quantifies connectedness as the average number of edges incident to its nodes”
		- “The eccentricity of a node is the longest shortest-path distance between it and every other node, representing how far it is from the node furthest from it (Urban and Keitt 2001).”
		- “A network’s diameter is its greatest eccentricity and its radius is its smallest eccentricity (Hage and Harary 1995)”
		- “A network’s center is the node with eccentricity equal to the radius”
		- “A network’s periphery is the node with eccentricity equal to the diameter.”
		- “Connectivity represents the fewest number of nodes or edges that will disconnect the network if they are removed (Urban and Keitt 2001; O’Sullivan 2014), and thus indicates resilience.”
		- “A network’s average node connectivity more usefully denotes how many nodes must be removed on average to disconnect a randomly selected pair of nodes (Beineke et al. 2002)”
		- “Brittle points of vulnerability characterize networks with low average connectivity: traffic jams and disruptions can arise when the urban form forces circulation through low-permeability choke points.”
		- “A node’s clustering coefficient represents the ratio between its neighbors’ links and the maximum number of links that could exist between them (Opsahl and Panzarasa 2009). Jiang and Claramunt (2004) adapt this indicator to neighborhoods.”
		- “Porta et al. (2006) develop a multiple centrality assessment for urban street networks and use it to differentiate the signatures of planned cities versus self-organized cities. Crucitti et al. (2006) measure urban network centrality through a blend of closeness, betweenness, and information centralities.”
		- “A dual representation inverts this topology, depicting the streets as nodes and the intersections as edges, and provides some analytical advantages in studying network structure (Crucitti et al. 2006). Space syntax studies this dual representation of urban street networks, analyzing axial streets and measuring the depth between edges (Hillier et al. 1976). However, space syntax’s dual networks inherently disregard geometric, spatial, experiential information important to urban design that primal networks retain (Ratti 2004). Nevertheless, it underlies various adapted approaches to analytical urban design (Karimi 2012).”
