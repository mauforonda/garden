title:: The lifespan of a notebook

- I've been taking notes very regularly for more than a decade in multiple _very_ short-timed notebooks. The lifespan of a notebook consists of:
	- I realize that I need to nurture some internal dialogue to think clearly.
	- I spend time setting up a note taking system that I _inevitably_ tweak to death so that it enables some ideal workflow that I believe fits well with the ideas I want to write down.
		- The initial idea is always some combination of expressiveness and speed. You should drop ideas as they come, without thinking where exactly they might fit or what they could become. This should not stop you from building on them in ever more elaborate forms.
		- But as always, the devil's in the details. What is a rich-enough format? What tools and affordances do you need to drop ideas fast? How far are you willing to deviate from standards that make your notes portable and interoperable? What tools and affordances do you need to rediscover, retrieve and reuse past ideas? How far do you want to integrate non-desktop interfaces, especially mobile?
	- I take notes for a time span between one week to some months without tweaking too much, depending on how well the notebook prototype turns out.
	- Eventually all the little inconveniences mount up, I obsess over whatever it is I _definitely_ can't do with the system and real life anxieties hit hard enough that all I can think of when looking at the notebook is how constraining it feels.
	- I will avoid the system until my mind clears a little and the desire for internal dialogue comes back.
