  abstract = {Complex systems have become a popular lens for analyzing cities, and complexity theory has many implications for urban performance and resilience. This paper develops a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design. It extends quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics,~and information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form.~Today, prominent urban design movements openly embrace complexity~but~must move beyond metaphor and inspiration to~formalize what "complexity" is and how we can use~it to assess both the world as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.},

\par
“a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design.”
\par
“Urban designers often discuss urban form and design projects in terms of complexity (e.g., Duany et al. 2001; Macdonald 2002; Talen 2003; Alexander 2003; Sanders 2008; Congress for the New Urbanism 2015)”
\par
“positively correlated with disorder and includes algorithmic complexity and most measures of entropy. Here, complexity is highest when objects are scrambled up with the greatest variety and diversity.” Category I complexity in the typology described in Shiner et al. (1999)
\par
“a convex function of disorder, peaking at some midpoint between order and disorder. This balances variety and structure, conforming to traditional definitions of complex adaptive systems” Category II
\par
“order or structure alone, favoring self-organization and emergence in which structure emerges from disorder.” Category III
\par
“Derived from Shannon entropy, mean information gain assesses how much new information is gained from each subsequent datum in a time series (Proulx and Parrott 2008) and fluctuation complexity measures the amount of structure within a time series by evaluating the order of and relationship between its values.” On measures of temporal complexity
\par
“they can be abstracted and re-appropriated to evaluate the human experience of moving through the physical space”
\par
“Much of the research on human perception of the built environment follows in the wake of Gibson’s (1979) ecological framework and Appleton’s (1975) prospect–refuge theory (e.g., Tveit et al. 2006; Ode et al. 2010).” On measures of visual complexity
\par
“Ewing and Clemente (2013) perform a literature review yielding 51 perceptual qualities of urban environments, eight of which they select for further study because of their importance across the literature: imageability, enclosure, human scale, transparency, coherence, legibility, linkage, and visual complexity (cf. Ewing and Handy 2009).”
\par
“Cavalcante et al. (2014) provide an alternate, statistical image processing measure of urban visual complexity.”
\par
“Slow-moving pedestrians need a high level of complexity to hold their interest, but fast-moving motorists find that same environment chaotic”
\par
“Boeing (2018b) adapts entropy measures to analyze urban spatial order through street orientations. Yeh and Li (2001) use entropy to monitor and track urban sprawl. Applying these information-theoretic metrics to space usually entails analyzing raster data for predictability.” On measures of spatial complexity
\par
“Wissen Hayek et al. (2015) measure land use mix and density to evaluate the quality of the neighborhood-scale urban environment. The Simpson diversity index measures the entropy of objects across space and is a common measure of land use mixture in urban design research (economists often call it the Herfindahl–Hirschmann index, while ecologists call it the probability of interspecies encounter). It is an integral measure that considers land use in a district as a whole, ignoring microscale structure (Song et al. 2013a).”
\par
“Measures of topological structure assess the shape and physical configuration of a system. They are perhaps the most applicable measures of the complexity outcomes of urban design because they characterize that which is most dependent upon the design process: physical structure and topological arrangement.”
\par
“Fractal structure refers to the roughness and self-similarity of some object, and how its detail relates to the scale at which it is observed (Jiang and Yin 2014).” On measures of scaling complexity
\par
“Batty (e.g., 2005) has demonstrated how city structure and urban peripheries are fractal. Their features tend to be distributed according to a power law (a scale-free distribution)”
\par
“Murcio et al. (2015) measure urban transfer entropy to examine multi-scale patterns and flows.”
\par
“Measures of fractal dimension include the Hausdorff dimension and the box-counting dimension (Shen 2002).”
\par
“The average street segment length is a linear proxy for block size and indicates the network’s grain.” On measures of connectivity
\par
“Average circuity measures the ratio of edge lengths to the great-circle distances between the nodes these edges connect, indicating the street pattern’s efficiency (cf. Barthe ́lemy 2011).”
\par
“Topological measures of street network structure more robustly indicate connectedness and configuration.”
\par
“The network’s average node degree topologically quantifies connectedness as the average number of edges incident to its nodes”
\par
“The eccentricity of a node is the longest shortest-path distance between it and every other node, representing how far it is from the node furthest from it (Urban and Keitt 2001).”
\par
“A network’s diameter is its greatest eccentricity and its radius is its smallest eccentricity (Hage and Harary 1995)”
\par
“A network’s center is the node with eccentricity equal to the radius”
\par
“A network’s periphery is the node with eccentricity equal to the diameter.”
\par
“Connectivity represents the fewest number of nodes or edges that will disconnect the network if they are removed (Urban and Keitt 2001; O’Sullivan 2014), and thus indicates resilience.”
\par
“A network’s average node connectivity more usefully denotes how many nodes must be removed on average to disconnect a randomly selected pair of nodes (Beineke et al. 2002)”
\par
“Brittle points of vulnerability characterize networks with low average connectivity: traffic jams and disruptions can arise when the urban form forces circulation through low-permeability choke points.”
\par
“A node’s clustering coefficient represents the ratio between its neighbors’ links and the maximum number of links that could exist between them (Opsahl and Panzarasa 2009). Jiang and Claramunt (2004) adapt this indicator to neighborhoods.”
\par
“Porta et al. (2006) develop a multiple centrality assessment for urban street networks and use it to differentiate the signatures of planned cities versus self-organized cities. Crucitti et al. (2006) measure urban network centrality through a blend of closeness, betweenness, and information centralities.”
\par
“A dual representation inverts this topology, depicting the streets as nodes and the intersections as edges, and provides some analytical advantages in studying network structure (Crucitti et al. 2006). Space syntax studies this dual representation of urban street networks, analyzing axial streets and measuring the depth between edges (Hillier et al. 1976). However, space syntax’s dual networks inherently disregard geometric, spatial, experiential information important to urban design that primal networks retain (Ratti 2004). Nevertheless, it underlies various adapted approaches to analytical urban design (Karimi 2012).”},

  abstract = {Cities worldwide exhibit a variety of street network patterns and configurations that shape human mobility, equity, health, and livelihoods. This study models and analyzes the street networks of every urban area in the world, using boundaries derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. Street network data are acquired and modeled from OpenStreetMap with the open-source OSMnx software. In total, this study models over 160 million OpenStreetMap street network nodes and over 320 million edges across 8,914 urban areas in 178 countries, and attaches elevation and grade data. This article presents the study’s reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories of ready-to-use global street network models and calculated indicators, and discusses summary findings on street network form worldwide. It makes four contributions. First, it reports the methodological advances of this open-source workflow. Second, it produces an open data repository containing street network models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these models to produce an open data repository containing street network form indicators for each urban area. No such global urban street network indicator data set has previously existed. Fourth, it presents a summary analysis of urban street network form, reporting the first such worldwide results in the literature.},

“It uses the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) to define urban area boundaries and other variables. Using OSMnx, it downloads and models urban-scale street network data globally from OpenStreetMap, attaches elevation data, then calculates indicators for each urban area.” The data they build.
\par
“Across all urban areas worldwide, both total street length and intersection count scale sublinearly with population. Higher per capita GDP is associated with higher per capita total street length.” Some descriptive analysis they run on it.
\par
“A primal graph of a street network models intersections and dead-ends as nodes and the street segments that connect them as edges (Porta et al., 2006b). A dual graph of a street network does the opposite, modeling street segments as nodes and intersections as edges (Porta et al., 2006a).”
\par
“1) global coverage and availability, 2) consistent digitization and attribute data, 3) consistent representation of both geometric and topological data, and 4) better public accessibility and usability.” Areas where local street network data fails.
\par
“Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball (2017) found that, as of 2016, OpenStreetMap was 83\% complete worldwide, over 40\% of countries’ (including many”
\par
“developing countries) street networks were effectively 100\% complete, and completeness was highest in both dense cities and sparsely populated areas.” On the completeness of osm.
\par
“a recent project modeled the street networks of every US city/town, county, urbanized area, census tract, and Zillow-defined neighborhood, placed these models online in a public open data repository, and conducted spatial network analyses on them (Boeing, 2020a).” Usage examples of OSMnx to create streen network indicators.
\par
“Similarly, Dingil et al. (2018) used OSMnx to calculate transportation indicators for 151 urban areas worldwide. Karduni et al. (2016) created a data repository with 80 worldwide cities’ street networks derived from OpenStreetMap data. da Cruz et al. (2020) developed a database of urban indicators across 58 metropolitan areas worldwide, but did not include street network form indicators. Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball (2019, 2020) used all the streets mapped in OpenStreetMap to generate global indicators of street network disconnectivity to explore cross-sectional and longitudinal trends in urban sprawl.”
\par
“spatial boundaries derived from the publicly available GHSL Urban Centre Database1 (UCD) version 2019a 1.2, a project supported by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and DirectorateGeneral for Regional and Urban Policy (Florczyk et al., 2019). In addition to these urban area boundaries, the UCD provides attribute data such as the names of the country and core city, population, built-up area, gross domestic product (GDP), UN income class and development group, transport-sector emissions, particulate matter concentration, climate, and land use efficiency.” On the source of spatial boundary data.
\par
“the UCD consists of “high-density clusters of contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50,000” (Florczyk et al., 2019, p. 13).” the UCD is built with population data from censuses and satellite imagery.
\par
“three conditions: 1) is marked “true positive” in the UCD, 2) has ≥ 1 km2 built-up area, and 3) includes at least three OpenStreetMap drivable street network nodes within its boundaries. This comprises 8,914 total urban areas.” On how the author selects urban areas for which to create street networks.
\par
“This study models these street networks as nonplanar directed multigraphs with possible self-loops. All of these models are primal graphs to account for the full geographic characteristics of the street network (Ratti, 2004; Batty, 2005). The workflow retains all graph components even if they are not fully connected and is parameterized to retrieve all public drivable streets” The data they select from osm and the graph they make with it.
\par
“Raw OpenStreetMap data represent nodes as geometric vertices of straight-line segments composing more complex lines. Simplification produces a model that corresponds better to graph theory and transportation geography with nodes representing intersections and dead-ends and edges representing street segments.” How they process these data to produce clean graphs.
\par
“the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) v2 and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The ASTER DEM covers the world from 83° N to 83° S at a spatial resolution of one arcsecond (roughly 30 meters at the equator). The SRTM DEM covers the world from 60° N to 56° S at a spatial resolution of three arcseconds (roughly 90 meters at the equator). The ASTER DEM is finer resolution but exhibits more noise. The SRTM DEM is coarser resolution but less noisy, and was further processed by CGIAR-CSI to fix errors and fill voids (Gorokhovich and Voustianiouk, 2006).” The sources of elevation data.
\par
“It selects for each node whichever of the ASTER or SRTM elevation values has the least absolute difference from the corresponding Google value, as a validation reference point.” They treat google elevation data as the most reliable, but closed source, and select whichever open source approximates closer to it.
\par
“The circuity indicator is the graph’s ratio of street lengths to straight-line distances between adjacent nodes, and straightness is its inverse. The former measures how circuitous the street network is on average, whereas the latter measures how closely its streets approximate straight lines (Boeing, 2021).”
\par
“The elev\_mean, elev\_median, elev\_std, elev\_iqr, and elev\_range represent the calculated mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, and range of node elevations, in meters. These provide indicators of the topography underlying the network”
\par
“The grade\_mean and grade\_median fields represent the calculated mean and median street grade absolute values.”
\par
“The intersect\_count indicator represents the number of street intersections in the urban area—that is, the number of nodes with more than two incident edges in an undirected representation of the graph”
\par
“The intersect\_count\_clean indicator is calculated by merging intersections within 10 meter buffers of each other geometrically (i.e., 10 meter Euclidean radii) before counting them”
\par
“The intersect\_count\_clean\_topo indicator is calculated by merging intersections within 10 meters of each other topologically along the network. This prevents topologically remote but spatially proximate nodes from being merged.”
\par
“Clustering coefficients measure the extent to which a node’s neighbors form a complete graph (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004; Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009)”
\par
“The pagerank\_max indicator is the maximum PageRank value of any node in the urban area: PageRank ranks nodes’ importance based on the structure of their links (Agryzkov et al., 2012; Boeing, 2020a).”
\par
“The self\_loop\_proportion measures the urban area’s proportion of physical street segments that self-loop.”
\par
“The k\_avg indicator represents the average node degree of the undirected representation of the graph”
\par
“The length\_mean and length\_median indicators are the calculated mean and median physical street segment (i.e., undirected edge) lengths in meters,”
\par
“The street\_segment\_count and node\_count fields contain the counts of physical street segments and nodes respectively.”
\par
“The prop\_4way, prop\_3way, and prop\_deadend fields contain the proportions of nodes in the graph that represent four-way intersections, three-way intersections, and culs-de-sac respectively.”
\par
“The orientation\_entropy and orientation\_order indicators represent the calculated entropy of street bearings and their linearized and normalized order, as developed in Boeing (2019).”
\par
“Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball (2017) note that OpenStreetMap was particularly incomplete in China as of 2016 due to restrictions”
\par
“the elevation data are validated by comparing the ASTER, SRTM, and Google values for each node. Across all 37 million nodes worldwide, the elevation values between these three sources exhibit high correlation (all r {$>$} 0.999, p {$<$} 0.001).”
\par
“we compare our street networks’ elev\_mean indicator with the UCD’s estimated average elevation for each urban area. They strongly correlate (r {$>$} 0.999, p {$<$} 0.001) and the median difference between the two is 16 centimeters”},
