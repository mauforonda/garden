- El tráfico urbano es mucho más bajo desde que comenzaron las vacaciones escolares. Sería divertido medir el tráfico un día como hoy, quizás tomando capturas frecuentes de google traffic, y compararlo con la situación en una o dos semanas. Imagino un video con la secuencia de capturas lado a lado. #[[Random project ideas]]
- I was thinking a little about [[How to host, link and maybe display static files here]] ?
- I casually looked at [this tweet from Alice Evans](https://twitter.com/_alice_evans/status/1546868397752868865) that claims that fathers in Bolivia bathe their children in far higher proportions than fathers in other countries. A dataset that allows international comparisons in subtle gender differences and features Bolivia, this is something I have to check.
	- The dataset comes from the _The International Men and Gender Equality Survey_ ([IMAGES](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/)), which collects international data on "_practices and attitudes around gender equality_". Two thirds of the questionnaire are the same for all countries, but some questions are adapted for every local context. Each country has a separate documentation sheet, all of which are [listed in the website](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/study-notes/).

		- A quantitative study was carried out between April 8 and May 6, 2019 to understand the behavior and perceptions of the men and women populations in Bolivia between 18 and 59 years old. It was funded by the Swedish International Development Association (SIDA) and operated by the Centro de Generación de Información y Estadística ([CEGIE](https://www.upb.edu/es/centros-investigacion/cegie-investigadores)) of the UPB. The sample consisted of 887 women and 888 men from all 9 departments, in the urban and rural area. Urban blocks and rural communities were selected by stratifying the 2012 census results in two stages: by the proportion of urban to rural population, and by the proportion of the population that self-identified under different native groups. Subjects were selected randomly (so they claim) and questioned by interviewers of the same sex, who had previously participated in a 10-day training program. Finally, results were expanded by expansion factors based on the 2012 census.

		- A qualitative study was carried between October 2020 and January 2021 in which 57 men and 27 women, as well as 12 men and 5 women from 3 indigenous communities participated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews respectively. The study was designed by Acción por los Derechos Humanos and Promundo-US, and operated in collaboration with the Central de Organizaciones de Pueblos Nativos de Guarayos (COPNAG), Servicios Educativos (PROCESO) and the Centro de Investigación y Promoción del Campesinado (CIPCA).
	- Data can only be requested through [a form on their website](https://www.menandgendersurvey.org/request-data-access/), which seems to be reviewed manually. They don't ask any personal information beyond a name and email so who knows how they're deciding who can be trusted with the data (an `.edu` email?).
	- The [latest report](https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/International%20Men%20%26%20Gender%20Equality%20Survey%20%28IMAGES%29%20Global%20Report%202022_EN.pdf), from June 16 2022, claims that data from Bolivia , which was taken 3 years ago [see](((62cd916f-39cf-4206-9dc7-6c6d42976a45))), was just added this year.
		- Bolivia and Kuwait are the only surveyed countries where no man claims to decide on the children's education alone. This group includes Chile, Uganda and Tanzania when women are asked. The discrepancy indicates that in many households, important decisions are made together by the couple or alone by women, but publicly claimed only by men.
		- Bolivia is the top country in Latin America where men remember their fathers doing domestic work.
