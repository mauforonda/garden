- Quick highlights from a literature review of complexity measures for urban studies [[Boeing - Measuring the complexity of urban form and design]]
- I loved these images from [Towards a morphogenesis of informal settlements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397520303714) ![Evolution of street networks and settlements in Baseco, Manila between 2001â€“2017](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0197397520303714-gr3.jpg){:height 544, :width 319}
	- The paper itself isn't that interesting, as it makes little to no effort in formalizing urban growth dynamics. But the graphics, built with Google Earth + Streetview, look nice and easy to apply in other cases. Again, I should compare the coverage of informal settlements and street networks in different datasets + methods to infer these features from available satellite images.
